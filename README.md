Column editor in a webpage. Basically a multiple textfile editor.

Warning: Non-secure, localhost only, simple, optimistic coding.

I use this for project lists in my workshop.

Funny how little code this takes. The structure is in the textfile naming.
11Name.txt is first row, first column.
12Anothername.txt is first row, second column.
13Nextone.txt is first row, third column.
21Textfile.txt is second row, first column.
etc...
etc...

Designed to work with Fluid (makes an app from a webpage on OSX).
With the global hotkey F6 I get my project overview.
